        <p>A sales page exists to make a visitor turn into a customer. It does this by clearly demonstrating how your product or service solves their particular problem and its benefits.  

          While the definition of a sales page is pretty straightforward, many resources go into creating a great sales page.
          
          For example, you’ll have to do in-depth customer research to learn what underlying pain points they have around their problem. 
          
          Let’s say you have a men’s dating offer or coaching service. You may discover through customer research that they have underlying pain points beyond just finding a date. For example, they might feel out of place at a bar and just wish they could talk to women. 
          
          So rather than explaining what your product or service does (helping them find a date), it should also explain how it will make them feel and address underlying pain points (feel confident in a bar).
          
          Finally, a great sales page should also answer all of the reader’s objections. For example, they may say, “Well, that dating offer might work on 35-year-old guys, but it won’t work on someone who’s 45.”
          
          Case studies and testimonials are also key elements of sales pages and can help the customer identify with other similar people that found success with your product or service. 
          
          Ultimately, a great sales page knows the customer so well that the offer they make is irresistible.
        </p>
        <p>Most people drive traffic to their sales pages from email, social media ads, Google ads, or a website to create a sales page. Therefore, you need a post-click landing page software to host your sales page.

          Fortunately, there are a few landing page software options that are easy to use and don’t require coding knowledge. 
          
          Below is an overview of the three most popular ones, and while they have slight differences, all of them are easy to use and do essentially the same job. </p>
