          <p style="font-weight: lighter; font-size: 16px; line-height: 30px">
            A sales page is a standalone page created with one specific
            purpose in mind, to secure sales for your product. The product or
            service you’re selling on your page can differ depending on your
            industry or niche. However, the purpose of your sales page remains
            constant – getting visitors to convert into customers.

          <strong>There are two main options when it comes to creating sales pages;
            you can either:</strong><br />
          1.Hire expensive designers and developers to design and code the
          page for you<br />
          2.Choose the do-it-yourself option and create your page yourself
          using an easy, powerful post-click landing page platform like
          Instapage.<br />
          <strong>Instapage offers you the opportunity to create your post-click
            landing pages without any design or coding experience.
            Simply:</strong><br />
          1.Select a template from our vast array of free templates.<br />
          2.Customize the page to your liking.<br />
          3.Integrate with other applications.<br />
          4.Publish to the web.<br>
          Creating a sales page becomes extremely easy when you have the right software by your side and pre-optimized
          templates — that’s what Instapage has to offer.
          <!-- A sales page exists to make a visitor turn into a customer. It does
          this by clearly demonstrating how your product or service solves
          their particular problem and its benefits. While the definition of a
          sales page is pretty straightforward, many resources go into
          creating a great sales page. For example, you’ll have to do in-depth
          customer research to learn what underlying pain points they have
          around their problem. Let’s say you have a men’s dating offer or
          coaching service. You may discover through customer research that
          they have underlying pain points beyond just finding a date. For
          example, they might feel out of place at a bar and just wish they
          could talk to women. So rather than explaining what your product or
          service does (helping them find a date), it should also explain how
          it will make them feel and address underlying pain points (feel
          confident in a bar). Finally, a great sales page should also answer
          all of the reader’s objections. For example, they may say, “Well,
          that dating offer might work on 35-year-old guys, but it won’t work
          on someone who’s 45.” Case studies and testimonials are also key
          elements of sales pages and can help the customer identify with
          other similar people that found success with your product or
          service. Ultimately, a great sales page knows the customer so well
          that the offer they make is irresistible.
          <br /> -->
          <!-- <br />Most people drive traffic to their sales pages from email,
          social media ads, Google ads, or a website to create a sales page.
          Therefore, you need a post-click landing page software to host your
          sales page. Fortunately, there are a few landing page software
          options that are easy to use and don’t require coding knowledge.
          Below is an overview of the three most popular ones, and while they
          have slight differences, all of them are easy to use and do
          essentially the same job. <a href="#">Learn more</a> -->
